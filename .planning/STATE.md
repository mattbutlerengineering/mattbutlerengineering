## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: rialto-web migrated first — lowest risk, establishes pattern for all subsequent migrations
- [Roadmap]: Dashboard rename isolated as its own phase — Auth0 callback update must be atomic with the rename
- [Roadmap]: @mbe/ui deleted only in Phase 4 — after all three apps are migrated and typecheck clean
- [01-01]: Sidebar nav uses onClick+useNavigate not href — prevents full page reloads inside BrowserRouter
- [01-01]: RialtoProvider wraps BrowserRouter at root — ensures CSS token cascade applies to all routes
- [01-01]: Demo pages moved to /demos/* prefix — avoids route conflicts with new /components/* routes
- [01-01]: NAV_SECTIONS as source-of-truth — import into sidebar and routes.tsx for automatic route generation

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Pre-Phase 1]: Verify DigitalOcean `preservePathPrefix: false` behavior for SPAs in staging before assuming correct for all three static sites
- [Pre-Phase 4]: PWA service worker scope isolation when two PWAs share a domain — test in staging before production
